                There are a lot of places to go in Argentina. And Buenos Aires specifically is a big city with a lot of tourist locations and spots. However, I'll show you where I like to go. El coto de los juegos is a place I used to go a lot as a kind it is kind of like dave and busters. They also have a lot of food. Unfortunately it's not as popular as it used to be and it was sold out but it's still fun. Another place is the carnivals.

        Carnivals are quite fun. There are a lot of fancy Carnival photos but I chose the only one that really matters because I remember at these carnivals they sell a spray can with cream it's kind of like shaving cream but I'm not sure what it's made of. But it is safe and I remember spraying people in the face and absolutely melting them and that is fun I suggest it. Also there are obviously lots of food at carnivals and cool people walking by.

        There are also obviously tourist places like big churches and good buildings. It's a country with decent infrastructure. There is also a big stick. I'm not sure which is bigger here or the US.

                Go out and see our unique customs, eat meat with us and maybe try our very fancy Tango dance. :) We eat meat, dance tango, and we eat a lot of italian foods, also some people there are really good at cursing in spanish.

        There's lots of culture to explore. So go out! Explore. Have fun. Also don't take out your phone in public if you have an iphone. It's not that dangerous of a place it's just there aren't as many iphones. There are a lot of things you can enjoy. The unique cousine, the way people talk and act.'

        We have a very unique accent. Also there are a lot of soccer sports teams. But don't you dare call it SOCCER, it's called football. A lot of people here like futbol.
